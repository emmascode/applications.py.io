# Car-web-scraping
Using Python's library Beautiful Soup, the Requests Library and Pandas Dataframe, I am extracting data from a car dearlership website. The results will be stored inside an Excel File, including dealer name, mileage, model name, listing price, rating and number of reviews. This is useful for accessing avaialble data from websites and store them for analyzing or other uses. 

Website that I scrapped:
https://www.cars.com/shopping/results/?page=1&page_size=20&error_state=false&list_price_max=&location_input_value=&location_type=&makes[]=mercedes_benz&maximum_distance=all&models[]=&stock_type=cpo&zip=

Output includes a total of 380 cars and a sample is presented as follows:
